# [xTeVe Docker VPN](https://xteve.de/)

## [Ubuntu base image used from linuxserver/docker-baseimage-ubuntu](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-baseimage-ubuntu)

### Description

xTeVe is a M3U proxy server for Plex, Emby and any client and provider which supports the .TS and .M3U8 (HLS) streaming formats.

xTeVe emulates a SiliconDust HDHomeRun OTA tuner, which allows it to expose IPTV style channels to software, which would not normally support it.

OpenVPN has been added to this container to allow users to bypass shaping using a VPN connection. Hopefully this will help others as it has done so for me.

Credits to the programmers who did an amazing job on xTeVe, all I did was put this docker together for my needs.

## Usage

Here are some example snippets to help you get started creating a container.

### docker

```
docker create \
  --name=xteve \
  --net=host \
  -e PUID=1000 \
  -e PGID=1000 \
  -e UMASK_SET=022 `#optional` \
  -e XTEVE_DEBUG=0 `#optional` \
  -e XTEVE_BRANCH=master `#optional` \
  -p 34400:34400 `#required in bridge mode` \
  -v /path/to/config:/config \
  -v /path/to/tmp:/tmp/xteve \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/nealdb/xteve-vpn:master
```

## Parameters

Container images are configured using parameters passed at runtime (such as those above). These parameters are separated by a colon and indicate `<external>:<internal>` respectively. For example, `-p 8080:80` would expose port `80` from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port `8080` outside the container.

| Parameter | Function |
| :----: | --- |
| `--net=host` | Use Host Networking |
| `-p 34400:34400` | Port needs to be passed from host to container unless your not using OpenVPN and your in host mode |
| `-e PUID=1000` | for UserID - see below for explanation |
| `-e PGID=1000` | for GroupID - see below for explanation |
| `-e XTEVE_DEBUG=0` | Set xTeVe debug level [ 0-3 ] Default: 0=OFF |
| `-e DEBUG=false` | Set container debug [ true or false ] Default: false |
| `-e XTEVE_BRANCH=master` | Set xTeVe git branch [ master|beta ] Default: master  |
| `-v /config` | xTeVe library location. |
| `-v /tmp/xteve` | xTeVe Location for the buffer files. |

## Umask for running applications

For all of our images we provide the ability to override the default umask settings for services started within the containers using the optional `-e UMASK=022` setting.
Keep in mind umask is not chmod it subtracts from permissions based on it's value it does not add. Please read up [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umask) before asking for support.

## User / Group Identifiers

When using volumes (`-v` flags) permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container, we avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user `PUID` and group `PGID`.

Ensure any volume directories on the host are owned by the same user you specify and any permissions issues will vanish like magic.

In this instance `PUID=1000` and `PGID=1000`, to find yours use `id user` as below:

```
  $ id username
    uid=1000(dockeruser) gid=1000(dockergroup) groups=1000(dockergroup)
```

## Application Setup

Webui can be found at `<your-ip>:34400/web`

## OpenVPN
OpenVPN is built in but disabled by default. Currently the container has Surfshark, PIA and VyprVPN config files built in so all that's needed is to specify the ovpn file name with or without the .ovpn extension..

Surfshark I have found to be the best for IPTV, less buffering but this could be different for you. I only tested with PIA and Surfshark as I had accounts with them, more can be added in the future. I have also added the ability to use other OpenVPN config files so you are not limited to Surfshark, PIA or VyprVPN.

If you are running the VPN then use bridge mode otherwise you will have issues on your host.

#### List of OpenVPN parameters accepted by the container
| Parameter | Function |
| :----: | --- |
| `--net=bridge` | Use Bridge Networking |
| `--cap-add=NET_ADMIN` | Gives the container permission to make network changes |
| `-e OPENVPN_USERNAME=username` | Your VPN provider username |
| `-e OPENVPN_PASSWORD=password` | Your VPN provider password |
| `-e OPENVPN_CONFIG=Ca Toronto` | Configuration file for the VPN location (Not required when using CUSTOM provider, will find the first file in the openvn directory) |
| `-e OPENVPN_PROVIDER=PIA` | VPN Provider - SURFSHARK, PIA, VYPRVPN or CUSTOM |
| `-e OPENVPN_OPTIONS=--ping 60 --ping-restart 180` | Custom OpenVPN options (Leave blank if your unsure, this is just an example) |
| `-e OPENVPN_PROTOCOL=udp` | VPN Protocol udp or tcp (Not needed when using CUSTOM provider) |
| `-e CREATE_TUN_DEVICE=true` | Should the container create /dev/net or are you mounting it |
| `-e LOCAL_NETWORK=192.168.0.0/24` | Your local lan network (Required in order to reach xTeVe web gui) |
| `-e NAME_SERVERS=209.222.18.222,209.222.18.218,37.235.1.174,37.235.1.177,1.1.1.1,1.0.0.1` | Containers DNS servers to use (Not required by default) Due to Google and OpenDNS supporting EDNS Client Subnet it is recommended NOT to use either of these |

#### PIA config files can be found here

#### SURFSHARk config files can be found here

#### VyprVPN config files can be found here

https://support.vyprvpn.com/hc/article_attachments/360052617332/Vypr_OpenVPN_20200320.zip

#### If you wish to use your own custom ovpn file and provider, just place your ovpn file in a folder called openvpn inside your config directory and change OPENVPN_PROVIDER=CUSTOM. An openvpn folder will be created automatically on the first boot. 

OPENVPN_CONFIG does not need to be set when OPENVPN_PROVIDER=CUSTOM and you have placed your own ovpn file in the openvpn directory. The first found ovpn file will be used.

Create any credential and certificate files required and place in referenced areas 

#### Testing VPN throughput with speedtest-cli

Speedtest cli is installed in the container and can be used to test your throughput from within the container, more information can be found here.

https://www.speedtest.net/insights/blog/introducing-speedtest-cli/

You will need to ssh into the running container to run speedtest cli

```docker exec -ti xteve-vpn bash```

Or from host

```docker exec -t xteve-vpn sh -c 'speedtest --accept-license --accept-gdp'```

Enjoy!
